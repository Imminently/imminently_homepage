                <div class="about-content">
                    <p>Imminently was born from the desire to help technology start-ups build for the enterprise, at a lower cost and higher pace than traditional start-up models. Importantly, to help start-ups avoid the decision to cut corners that compromise underlying scale, robustness, and security due to the traditional effort, costs and resourcing required to achieve this.</p>
                    <p>Imminently has developed the Cloud Adaptive Framework, a pro-code platform that brings the technical and operational scaffolding to build enterprise-grade B2B and B2C software-as-a-service products. With strong foundations in place from the outset, you can focus your development effort on the code that makes your start-up unique.</p>
                    <p>If you've got a great idea, but don't know how to move forward - don't worry! We can provide you with a full product realisation capability that spans market research and feasibility; service and user design; product development; and product operationalisation.</p>
